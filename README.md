# Book Sales Management System

A modern, responsive, and offline-first system for small businesses to manage book inventory, sales, and genres. This application is built with vanilla TypeScript, HTML, and CSS, and it runs entirely in the browser using `localStorage` for data persistence.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Book Management:** Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for your book inventory.
-   **Genre Management:** Organize books into customizable genres.
-   **Sales Tracking:** Easily log sales for any book in your inventory, which automatically updates stock levels.
